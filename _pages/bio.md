For pandemic reasons I'm currently working remotely from Chennai, India but I'm
typically based out of either Cape Town, South Africa or Socorro, USA. I
completed my PhD in 2018 from [IISER, Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in) where
I worked on developing new algorithms to identify and flag radio frequency
intereference in [GMRT](https://gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in) observations, primarily
focusing on the 150 MHz frequency band.

At present I'm working with [Russ
Taylor](http://www.ast.uct.ac.za/ast/staff/russ-taylor) and team on
commissioning the polarization science products from the
[MIGHTEE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01901) survey, a deep extragalactic survey
with the aim of detecting some of the faintest/youngest galaxies seen to date. 

I also work with [Sanjay Bhatnagar](https://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~sbhatnag/) and
team on developing new (polarization) imaging algorithms, with an eye on
realizing the science goals of MIGHTEE.
