Hello! I'm a post-doctoral research fellow, working with
[IDIA](https://www.idia.ac.za) and [NRAO](https://www.nrao.edu). I'm primarily
interested in developing new algorithms and methods to visualize, calibrate,
and image the (astronomically) large data sets that a modern radio telescope
produces.

You can find a reasonable (albeit potentially out-of-date) summary of my
professional life here,  so feel free to take a look around and get in touch if
you want to chat!
